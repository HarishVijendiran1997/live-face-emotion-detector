# 🎥 Live Face Emotion Detector

This is a simple React app that uses [`face-api.js`](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js) to detect a user's face and recognize their dominant emotion in real-time using their webcam.

The app draws a bounding box around the face and displays the most likely emotion with an emoji. For better usability on mobile, the canvas overlay is hidden on smaller screens.
